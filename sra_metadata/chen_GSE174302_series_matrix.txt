!Series_summary	"We sequenced cell-free RNA (cfRNA) for five cancer types (colorectal cancer, stomach cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer and esophageal cancer) and healthy individuals in 230 plasma samples collected from 6 clinical centers in China.  Cancer related signaling pathway and microbial genus were identified. Cancer detection and specific classification were achieved through combining both host and microbial cfRNA reads."
